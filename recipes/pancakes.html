        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients: </strong>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients: </strong>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the pancakes: </strong>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
